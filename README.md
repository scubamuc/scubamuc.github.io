For self-hosted [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) I turned to [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) and [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/#installing-a-package) to create an [LXC-container](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/containers-lxc) for [Nextcloud-snap](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap). There's a great community behind Nesxtcloud-snap and support is fantastic. The greatness of Linux together with good hardware enables anyone to run a 24/7 nextcloud server. 

I'm neither a Linux crack nor an admin... so my goal is a simple setup with ample ressources for 5 family users, low cost, low energy footprint and low maintenence. My day job is software support for a leading WMS. I'm an avid scuba diver and enjoy Linux and FOSS.
