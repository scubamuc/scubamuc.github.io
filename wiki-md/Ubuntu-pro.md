# Ubuntu Pro

"Ubuntu Pro" is a great service if you have an Ubuntu-one account already.

## advantages:

 * 5 free subscriptions for private use
 * added security for internet facing servers
 * peace of mind
 * easy to set up and manage
 * "Kernel Livepatch" to avoid unscheduled reboots is not required (some knowledgable people don't agree that this is an advantage!)

personally I'd upgrade LTS nonetheless
