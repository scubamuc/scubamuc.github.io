# Ubuntu Pro

"Ubuntu Pro" is a great service if you have an Ubuntu-one account already.

advantages:

    5 free subscriptions for private use
    Kernel Livepatch to avoid unscheduled reboots
    added security for internet facing servers
    peace of mind
    easy to set up and manage

personally I'd upgrade LTS nonetheless
