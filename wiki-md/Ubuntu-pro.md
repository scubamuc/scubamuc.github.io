# Ubuntu Pro

[**Ubuntu Pro**](https://ubuntu.com/pricing/pro) is a great service if you have an [Ubuntu One](https://login.ubuntu.com) account already anyway.

## advantages and opinions:

 * 5 free subscriptions for private use --> (*included in [Ubuntu One](https://login.ubuntu.com)*)
 * 10 years support instead of 5 for 'Universe' and 'Main' --> (*personally I'd upgrade LTS nonetheless*)
 * peace of mind
 * easy to set up and manage
 * "Kernel Livepatch" - not required! --> *(sic. @kyrofa: some knowledgable people don't agree that this is an advantage!)*

**NB.**
> Any of: KVM | Qemu | Boch, VMWare ESXi, LXD | LXC, Xen, Hyper-V (WSL, Multipass), VirtualBox, z/VM, Docker. All Nodes in the cluster have to be subscribed to the service in order to benefit from the unlimited VM support
